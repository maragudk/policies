# Refund Policy

I want my customers to be happy with the service I provide. The PodHeart refund policy is simple: If you're ever unhappy with PodHeart, for any reason, just contact [support@podheart.com](mailto:support@podheart.com) and we'll figure it out together.

## Examples of full refunds

* If you were just charged for your next month of PodHeart, but you meant to cancel, I'm happy to refund that extra charge.
* If you forgot to cancel PodHeart a couple of months ago, and you haven't used PodHeart since then, I'll give you a full refund for a few back months.
* If you tried PodHeart for a couple of months, and you just weren't happy with it, you can have your money back.

## Examples of partial refunds or credits

* If you forgot to cancel PodHeart a year ago, and there's been activity on your account since then, I'll review your account usage and figure out a partial refund based on how many months you used it.
* If PodHeart had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month), I'd issue a partial credit to your account.

## Get in touch

At the end of the day, nearly everything comes down to a case-by-case basis. [Send me an email](mailto:support@podheart.com), tell me what's up, and I'll work with you to make sure you're happy.
